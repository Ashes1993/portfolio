## ⚡ Engineering Philosophy

I didn't take the traditional computer science path. My perspective is strictly logic-driven, focused on solving business problems through efficient, scalable architecture. My core philosophy is simple: **Shipping is the only metric that matters.**

This portfolio is not just a static document; it is a demonstration of that philosophy, featuring complex state interactions, custom media handling, and hardware-accelerated animations.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture & Features

### UI / UX Engineering

- **Hardware-Accelerated Rendering:** Strategic use of `transform-gpu` and `will-change` properties to isolate layers and completely eliminate "composite explosion" layout thrashing during heavy blur and glassmorphism transitions.
- **Zero-Lag Navigation:** A custom scroll-spy navigation system that seamlessly transitions from CSS-driven mobile layouts to Framer Motion desktop animations without taxing device CPUs.
- **Interactive Data Visualization:** Custom-built "JSON-to-UI" sliders that dynamically demonstrate data transformation pipelines in real-time.

### Featured Projects Integration

- **[Grimsy](https://grimsy.top):** Showcased via an interactive, draggable mobile mockup utilizing Framer Motion gesture controls and physics-based boundaries.
- **[Archive Discovery](https://archive-discovery.vercel.app):** Integrated via a custom-engineered HTML5 video player built completely from scratch. Bypasses native browser limits to provide DOM-based volume controls, mobile tap-to-seek logic, and accurate buffering states.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (React)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with complex custom variants and arbitrary values)
- **Animation:** Framer Motion (Iterative layout animations, physics-based dragging)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Serverless)
